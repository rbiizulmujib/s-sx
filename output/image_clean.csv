Chrome",FQ8257-002,"Get futuristic with the Nike Clogposite Chrome. Slick, sleek, and superbly comfortable, these clog-styled shoes give a fresh take on the clog and mule silhouette while providing a breathable footwear solution that doesn’t skimp on style.

With mesh side paneling for breathability and a stylish black foam upper sitting on top of the silver base of the shoe, these metallic shoes have the signature Nike check mark embossed twice on both shoes.

This version of the Nike ACG Torre Mid Waterproof has a durable black textile base for its waterproof upper. This base appears on the side panels, the top of the toe box, and around the ankle. Olive Grey suede overlays support the upper by forming the toe cap panel, supporting the eyestays, and forming the heel counter. A black Swoosh appears on each side, while ACG branding is seen on the lateral heel. A red and purple pull tab on the heel and red laces with purple eyestays are the only deviations from the neutral color scheme. A Nike logo also appears on the tongue. The durable midsole and outsole are thick black rubber for traction.

White neoprene accents improve comfort around the upper, with crimson branding adding some depth. The outsole is translucent and offers you longevity and extra grip. The Clogposite was initially introduced as a performance-inspired option, and it reimagines a clunky shoe in typical Nike fashion, turning it into something trendy and popular.

As experts, one standout feature of the Nike Clogposite Light Orewood Brown is its Foamposite makeup, which is well known for its resilience. Another key detail is the slip-on design, making it much easier to put your shoe on and remove it.

"Nike Benassi
Stussy Volt",CW2787-300,"The Nike Benassi Stussy Volt is a slide sandal that came about as a collaboration between Nike and the Californian skate and surf brand, Stussy.

This iteration of the Nike Benassi comes in a Bright Cactus Green and yellow colorway. It dominates the insole, outsole, and foot strap. The insole and outsole are made of rubber for traction, and the insole is textured for cushioning and comfort. The insole also contains the Nike logo and Swoosh. The cushioned foot strap is made of nylon and polyester for comfort. It is also Bright Cactus in color, but it contains the Stussy logo in white. The shoe is mostly waterproof, but you should avoid soaking the foot strap in water for too long.

Our favorite feature of these slides is the Bright Cactus color, which makes the shoe perfect for beachwear.

Kyler Murray",FN6721-100,"The Nike Vapor Edge Dunk Kyler Murray is part of a collaboration between Nike and American football player Kyler Murray.

This sneaker applies football-specific features to the Nike Vapor Edge Dunk silhouette. For example, the outsole boasts protruding studs in Vibrant Rose Gold. Although the base is white, Rose Gold elements can also be found on the Swoosh and on the metal aglets at the end of the laces. This color symbolizes Murray’s elegance as he plays, while the word ""family"" in Korean pays homage to Kyler Murray’s roots. Other symbolic elements include ‘Be 1 of ONE’ printed under the tongue, which represents the athlete’s mission to inspire children to become the best version of themselves.

Our experts at StockX like that the insole is locked onto the plate. This prevents the foot from sliding inside the shoe during quick movements.

A sawtooth design combined with rubber lugs on the outsole provide superior traction and grip.

Phantom",DJ6229-001,"The Nike Offline 2.0 Phantom is a slip-on shoe with a forefoot strap made for comfort.

The Phantom Nike Offline 2.0 is made with a fabric upper, part of which is regular textile and the other part is recycled polyester.

A small Nike Swoosh is seen embroidered on the outer side. The top part of the strap has a bit of a phantom pattern with a mix of shades of gray. Cord laces zigzag across the top for an adjustable and secure fit, while a large darker gray Nike Swoosh appears in the middle. There is also a pull tab at the top of the strap. The outsole is thick rubber in different shades of gray.

Be True (2020)",CU9189-900,"The Nike ACG Air Deschutz Be True 2020 was released as part of Nike’s Nike ACG Air Deschutz collection that features a line of all-weather sandals - hence the ACG acronym, which stands for ""All Conditions Gear.""

The sandals feature a predominantly black color scheme with multi-color accents on the inner linings. The forefoot has a red lining, while the ankle straps feature a purple one on the front, green and blue on either side, and yellow on the heel strap. Other stand-out features on the shoe include the translucent heel tab with Be True branded across it, and the Nike Air logo with a pride flag behind the heel strap.

What we love about the Nike ACG Air Deschutz Be True 2020 is the pride-themed color accents that celebrate diversity and inclusivity in society.

"Nike Offline
Stone Mauve",CJ0693-200,"The Nike Offline Stone Mauve released at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and was dubbed the ""anti-sneaker"" by Nike when it was first introduced. The company encouraged people to put on a pair of Nike Offlines when they needed to ""recharge"" from their daily grind.

Each pair of Nike Offlines came with two different drop-in midsoles that could be worn interchangeably. They have small nubs that were strategically positioned near foot pressure points to provide people with a ""massage-like experience"" when they put them on. These shoes also included tongues with plenty of padding and straps that has cushioning placed underneath them.

In our expert opinion, Nike’s outside-the-box thinking with this shoe design helped set them apart from other shoes that were made for kicking back and relaxing.

"Nike Vapor Edge Speed 360
Black",CD0082-001,"The Nike Vapor Edge Speed 360 Black is a football cleat designed for speed, agility, and optimal performance on the gridiron.

The cleats have a sleek and lightweight design featuring a synthetic upper along with a low-top silhouette that allows for maximum ankle mobility. They have a black and white color palette with black covering most of the cleats while white appears subtly on the collar lining, part of the underfoot, and on the Swoosh with a gradient effect that slowly fades from black to white and then back to black. Branding elements include the iconic Swoosh running on both sides as well as Vapor 360 Speed branding on the tongue and lower ankle.

What our experts love about the Nike Vapor Edge Speed 360 Black is the soleplate and cleat configuration which is designed to provide traction and grip on various football field surfaces. The underfoot cleats are specifically molded and strategically placed to enhance acceleration, agility, and quick directional changes. The shoes were first released at the retail price of $95 in June 2022.",https://images.stockx.com/360/Nike-Vapor-Edge-Speed-360-Black/Images/Nike-Vapor-Edge-Speed-360-Black/Lv2/img01.jpg?w=576&q=60&dpr=3&updated_at=1744392270&h=384%201x,https://stockx.com/nike-vapor-edge-speed-360-black

Safari",BQ4804-101,"The Nike Air Max 1 Golf Safari was released as part of the ""Safari Pack"" collection to celebrate the 2019 US PGA Championship. It is a transformation of the iconic 1987 original to suit the demands of the golf course.

The Safari Nike Air Max 1 Golf combines white, Red, Cement Grey, and Black Habanero across its construction. The upper is made from white leather which adds to its durability and waterproofing elements. The sneaker has a classic wavy mudguard and a vibrant red signature Nike Swoosh across its sides. The shoe has integrated traction that provides stability on grass as you golf and a visible Max Air unit above it provides cushioning.

What our experts say is the most outstanding feature of the Nike Air Max 1 Golf Safari is the animal-print graphic in Cement Grey and Black Habanero on the mudguard. This print puts you in touch with your wild side on the course, in a way.

Flash Lime",CU9978-100,"The Nike Air Max 90 Golf Flash Lime transforms Tinker Hatfield’s classic running sneaker into a golf shoe, complete with flex grooves that facilitate a natural range of movement on the links.

Unlike the classic Air Max 90, this version includes no-sew skin across the mesh upper instead of suede overlays and a leather mudguard. This alteration gives the upper a more streamlined design and means dew on the grass won’t damage the suede. While the base comes in Crisp White, hits of Flash Lime can be found on the molded eyelet panel, the heel patch, and the midsole’s wedge. Visible Air Max units can be seen through transparent windows in the heel, and provide lightweight cushioning.

Something our StockX experts like is the subtle gray Swoosh on the side panels.
